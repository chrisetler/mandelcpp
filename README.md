# mandelcpp
A lightweight mandelbrot viewer written in C++ with freeglut and opgengl. 

## To run
Make sure openGl and freeglut are installed. Those should be the only two dependencies.


## Controls

1. To move around, use the arrow keys
2. To zoom, use plus and minus
3. Note that the image is not automatically refreshed each time. This is because it takes a lot of computing power to do so. To refresh, press F5 or Space
4. To return to the original position, press 'r'
5. Use the number keys to select a color setting (need to refresh to see new colors)
